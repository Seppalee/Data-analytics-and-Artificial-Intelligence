    "- In this exercise you utilize the *DisneylandReviews.csv* located in data_files directory.\r\n",
    "- This exercise has the following phases:\r\n",
    "    - Load the data from csv file.\r\n",
    "    - Create directory structure including sample files from the data you loaded.\r\n",
    "    - Train your neural network with the extracted data.\r\n",
    "    - Validate the operation of your trained model.\r\n",
